## Introduction
Many players have self-reported their reflexivity behaviors while playing video games like Disco Elysium, Detroit: Become Human and Life is Strange. However, there is still little investigation of the design principle of video games to support players’ reflexivity. Thus, in this research, we hope to carry out a design model guiding designers build a game to support reflexivity.   
   
To further illustrate the design model, we decided to produce a reflexive game targeting at solving social issues in the field of family education. Due to the predominant of extreme paternalism among Chinese middle-class parents, many heart-breaking incidents have happened. In the past fifty years, China has rapidly completed urbanization, which means many Chinese completed the transformation from farmers to urban middle class in a very short time. The fast and smooth transformation also shaped the strong habitus of Chinese middle class. They incline to use their best effort to continue improving their social status or at least maintain it. However, many reasons like the worse social mobility, increasing income inequality and wide spreading anxiety by social media force parents investing huge amount of money and time in education. They hope they could get the result they want if everything follows their plan. But the reality did not. Once absurdity shows in their life, they will easily become insane. For instance, if a parent tried different methods to help their children to learn mathematics, the parent can easily feel the powerlessness, helplessness, and meaninglessness while the children just cannot answer the question correctly. They cannot find an excuse for these feelings, so they can only choose to punish and scold their children, or punish themselves by suicide.    
   
Therefore, the game aims at letting parents reflect their parenting style, raising the parents’ awareness of the weakness of their rational judgement and helping them face absurdity during family educating.

## Game Description
The game is still in the process of production. The GIFs below illustrate some key moments to support reflexivity.   
   
Before describing the reflexive moments, there is a brief introduction to the games. The game tells a story that a mother and her daughter were lost in a forest. However, the mother’s eyes have a different view with the daughter’s. This made their escape difficult.

In this level, the mother can easily pass across the platforms because the color of some of them were darker than other. Comparing with this, the girl cannot pass this level because these platforms have no difference in her eyes.

When the player act as the daughter, she saw a different view.

## Other Works
### BallFight
A two-player battle game.   
The player can use XBOX-controller to move and rotate the watermelon.   
Notice! The force of the movement can affect the force of the rotation, so you need to strike a balance between movement and attack!
